This infrastructure was developed to provide weekly assessments of risk levels for different countries in relation to the countries’ overall levels of infection, epidemic growth, and indications of trend acceleration. This infrastructure is written in R, and relies on the following key components: Rmarkdown (.Rmd) reports implementing the data gathering, preparation, analysis, and producing synthesis reports the reportfactory providing the backbone of the infrastructure a public github repository used for hosting files, version control, and automation through github actions "],["what-does-this-infrastructure-do.html", "1.1 What does this infrastructure do?", " 1.1 What does this infrastructure do? This infrastructure provides an automated data pipeline which gather publicly available data on COVID-19 cases, deaths, tests, as well as on Variants of Interest/Concerns (VoI / VoC) and vaccination by country, to provide weekly assessment of COVID-19 dynamics and levels of risks. The pipeline is implemented as a reportfactory which simplifies the handling of dependencies, data and scripts, and enables the compilation of analysis reports locally stored in dedicated, time-stamped folders. A series of Rmd reports performs data gathering, various analysis, and produce the following information products: png figures (pinplots and tadpoles) summarising the dynamics per WHO region, stored on github and visible on the README.md page (i.e. landing page of the repository) rds files containing the results for each WHO region, also stored on github, which can then be used for further investigation or for interactive dashboards (e.g. shiny apps); some of these analyses are computer-intensive and would not be readily available on dashboards otherwise automated emails to a specific list of recipients providing a detailed report of countries classified into epidemiological risk levels based on incidence, growth and trend changes; this latter part is not stored on github "],["content-of-this-handbook.html", "1.2 Content of this handbook", " 1.2 Content of this handbook This handbook is organised into the following chapters: Chapter 2 - Getting started.

Results presented here do not represent the official view of the WHO, its staff or consultants. Caution must be taken when interpreting all data presented, and differences between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other sources using different inclusion criteria and different data cut-off times are to be expected. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change. All counts are subject to variations in case detection, definitions, laboratory testing, vaccination strategy, and reporting strategies.

It is summarised in figure 2.1. The infrastructure itself is a reportfactory, which provides a structure for storing data, auxiliary scripts, reports sources and their outputs. Its key components include: a set of Rmarkdown reports detailed in chapter 3 a set of github actions implementing automated tasks on github servers, and detailed in **chapter 5 Figure 2.1: Overview of the infrastructure. This diagram represents the flow of information processed by the data pipelines. Data are gathered from the net by the WHO-private package phifunc, and processed by a series of Rmd reports. Some of the information products generated, indicated by a star, are not stored on github in order to reduce the size of the repository. Upon compilation, all reports outputs are stored in an /outputs/ folder (not shown on the diagram). The automated email (last step) can only be sent by github actions, as it requires SMTP credentials only stored as github secrets.

To run the full pipeline, the user will need an authentication token used to install the private (i.e. not publicly available) WHO package phifunc, which is used for collating data. 2.3.1 Downloading the repository You can download the repository from the code tab on the github page as illustrated in the figure 2.2. Figure 2.2: Downloading or cloning the repository. The repository containing the data infrastructure can be downloaded as a zip archive or cloned using github. We recommend using SSH to clone the repository. For more information on setting up an SSH access to github, see this webpage. Once you are set up to access github using SSH, you can clone the repository using GIT from the command line in your favourite terminal, by typing: git clone git@github.com:whocov/trend_analysis_public.git The advantage of cloning the repository rather than merely downloading a zip archive is that you will be able to update the infrastructure automatically using git pull. By default, your local copy of the repository will be called trend_analysis_public. It is possible to change this name, but you will need to update the name of the factory in the factory_config file. From now on, we will refer to this folder as root folder. 2.3.2 Getting the phifunc authentication token The tool we use to collate COVID-19 data is a package called phifunc developed at WHO. Because this package internally uses some non-public data API, it is currently not shared publicly, and an authentication token is needed to be able to install it in R. This token is a kind of password, stored in a file called phifunc_token in the root folder. The easiest way to add this file is ask for it from someone in the COVID-19 analytics team, and add this file to the root of the project. Make sure you do not alter or rename it. Once phifunc_token is present in your infrastructure, the scripts installing dependencies will detect it automatically when run, and you will be able to run all analyses locally. 2.3.3 Installing dependencies To install the dependencies, open the reportfactory by double-clicking on open.Rproj, or otherwise starting an R session in the root folder (trend_analysis_public by default), and copy-paste the following commands: # install basic packages pkg &lt;- c(&quot;remotes&quot;, &quot;reportfactory&quot;) install.packages(pkg) # install deps for the factory reportfactory::install_deps() source(here::here(&quot;scripts&quot;, &quot;remote_packages.R&quot;)) Note that the last operation will require the authentication token (file phifunc_token) for installing phifunc, which is used for data collection and formatting. We will be working separately on a similar infrastructure using data that are directly publicly available. "],["running-the-infrastructure-locally.html", "2.4 Running the infrastructure locally", " 2.4 Running the infrastructure locally The data infrastructure can run in two modes: remotely, through github actions; this happens at specific times but can also be triggered manually locally, on your computer Here, we outline the local use. You will find more information about the github actions in the automation chapter. 2.4.1 Updating all analyses The simplest way to update all analyses is run the script run_factory.R (using source(run_factory.R), or step-by-step by opening the file in Rstudio), which will: download, assemble and pre-process the most recent data run a separate report for each WHO region, storing timestamped output in the outputs/ folder, as well as figures, notes, and rds files in the asmodee_outputs folder update the README file with the new analyses 2.4.2 Updating the data The report assemble_data.Rmd performs the data download, gathering and preparation. To update the data, run the following command within the factory: library(reportfactory) compile_reports(report = &quot;assemble&quot;) 2.4.3 Running analyses for a specific region The report regional_analyses.Rmd performs all analyses for a given WHO region, including calculations of growth rates and trend change detection using ASMODEE. The report automatically uses the latest version of the clean data (so needs to be run after assemble_data.Rmd if the data need updating). The parameter who_region determines which WHO region is analysed. Possible values are: AFRO, EMRO, EURO (default), PAHO, SEARO, WPRO. To run the report, type: library(reportfactory) reg &lt;- &quot;EURO&quot; # replace as appropriate cores &lt;- 4 compile_reports(report = &quot;regional_analyses&quot;, params = list(who_region = reg, n_cores = cores), subfolder = reg) where: reg is the letter code for the WHO region to use (in upper case) cores is the number of cores to be used for the ASMODEE analyses, which support parallelisation subfolder indicates the name of the folder in outputs where the timestamped results will be stored 2.4.4 Generating the synthesis report The report elr_synthesis collates the latest results for all WHO regions, classifies countries by level of risk, and produces a synthesis html report, alongside an .xlsx file dynamics_summary.xlsx summarising results and a list of excluded countries in the text file excluded_countries.txt. To compile this report, use: library(reportfactory) compile_reports(report = &quot;elr_synthesis&quot;) "],["reports.html", "Chapter 3 Overview of the reports", " Chapter 3 Overview of the reports This chapter provides some additional informations about the different Rmarkdown reports. For details of data processing and analyses, we refer to the respective documents, as we attempted to document all code in each report. We recommend compiling the reports first and looking at the html outputs generated as a more user-friendly alternative to inspecting the source code directly. Reports can be compiled by two ways: using reportfactory::compile_reports(...) where ... is a character string matching the name(s) of the reports to be processed (regular expression accepted); outputs will be stored in time-stamped folders inside outputs/ using the usual rmarkdown::render(...) where ... is the path of the Rmd document to process; outputs will be stored inside report_sources/ Some reports accept parameters, i.e. variables set at compilation time which can impact the results generated. This is typically used, for instance, to indicate which WHO region the analyses are to be performed on, and is a more sustainable alternative to handling separate reports for every region. The way to specify parameters is the same in both methods of compilation, and are passed as a list called param when compiling documents. For instance: library(reportfactory) compile_reports(report = &quot;analyses&quot;, params = list(who_region = &quot;AFRO&quot;) will compile the analysis report regional_analyses.Rmd (only match for the word \"analyses\") for the AFRO region. Default values of parameters are set in the YAML headers of the respective reports.

Unfortunately, this package uses WHO internal APIs for some of these tasks and cannot be made publicly available without exposing these APIs, which would be a security breach. As a result, the package can only be installed with an authentication token, which needs to be stored in a file called phifunc_token at the root of the project folder. 3.1.2 Outputs The main output of the report is a clean data file containing data for all countries named final_dat_[date].rds, a copy of which will be stored in the data/clean folder. These files are ignored by git, and will not be added to the github repository to reduce the size of the archive. 3.1.3 Parameters The report accepts the following parameters: import_data: a logical indicating of the data should be downloaded (TRUE, default), or if local copies of the last raw data downloaded should be used (FALSE) 3.1.4 Example compilation The following instructions will compile the report: library(reportfactory) compile_reports(report = &quot;assemble&quot;) "],["analyses-of-covid-19-dynamics-regional-analyses-rmd.html", "3.2 Analyses of COVID-19 dynamics: regional_analyses.Rmd", " 3.2 Analyses of COVID-19 dynamics: regional_analyses.Rmd This report uses the latest clean data performs a range of analyses for a specific WHO region.

This figure summarises the dynamics of COVID-19 at a national level, using three complementary metrics: the daily growth rate r (x axis), the currentl weekly incidence (y axis), and the number of net increases showing trend acceleration detected by ASMODEE (colors). Another variant of this figure uses weekly incidence of deaths per capita on the y axis. Countries to the right show faster epidemic growth, and countries near the top experience high levels of incidence. Countries displayed in red show signs of acceleration, so that they may move further to the right in the coming days.

Rather than attempting to estimate significant changes in growth rates or reproduction numbers, which can usually only be done after changes have been taking place for a week or two, ASMODEE tries to answer the question: “Are the last few days matching what we would expect given the previous trend in the data?”. Figure 4.1: Rationale of ASMODEE. This figure illustrates the key steps of ASMODEE for detecting recent changes in temporal trends. To answer this question, ASMODEE implements the following approach (Figure 4.1): Split the data in two sets: a testing set formed by the most ‘recent’ data (typically the last week), and a fitting set one used for charactering trends on the past few weeks (typically 6 - 10 weeks) prior to the testing set. Define a range of candidate models to characterise temporal trends in the fitting set. Extrapolate past trends to derive a 95% prediction interval (PI) for the last week of data. Identify data outside the PI as outliers, suggesting either a slow-down (below the PI), or an acceleration (above the PI). In our algorithm for defining ELR for countries, we use a criteria of 3 net increases as a sign of acceleration; net increases are defined as the number of outliers above the PI, minus the number of outliers below the PI, in the last 7 days. Step 2 is the crucial one to obtain good results. Defining the right set of candidate models to capture past trends is non-trivial, and is also the non-standard part of implementing ASMODEE, as model-generation is currently not implemented in trendbreaker, and requires ad-hoc code. In this chapter, we provide tips and explanations on how candidate models are generated, and can be adapted to other data streams. "],["a-unified-interface-for-linear-models.html", "4.1 A unified interface for linear models", " 4.1 A unified interface for linear models In this section, we outline the general principle of model generation for ASMODEE. All models used in ASMODEE use trending (Schumacher and Jombart 2021b), which provides a general interface for different types of statistical models, including: lm_model: linear regression, wrapper for lm glm_model: generalized linear models (GLM), wrapper for glm glm_nb_model: negative binomial GLM, wrapper for MASS:glm.nb The advantage of this interface is consitency of behaviours for various operations, e.g. fitting, predictions, confidence intervals and prediction intervals. The formula syntax of these models is the same as in regular models, so the user should not have new difficulties specifying models with trending. For more information on the package, see the dedicated website. To use asmodee, the user needs to provide a list of trending models. An example of such a list is provided by models in the code below, which implements different models of cases over time: a constant model with Gaussian error a linear temporal trend with Gaussian error a log-linear temporal trend with Poisson distribution a log-linear temporal trend with Negative Binomial distribution library(trending) models &lt;- list( cst = lm_model(cases ~ 1), linear = lm_model(cases ~ date), poisson = glm_model(cases ~ date, family = poisson), nb = glm_nb_model(cases ~ date) ) This assumes the data we will fit these models to will have a cases and a date column containing, respectively, the daily case incidence and the corresponding date as a Date object. However, these models would capture only simple trends (constant, linear, or exponential), and data are typically more complicated. The following sections illustrate how more flexible models can be added to the list of candidate models. "],["generating-candidate-models-general-principle.html", "4.2 Generating candidate models: general principle", " 4.2 Generating candidate models: general principle The approach to generating many candidate models used in regional_analysis.Rmd is to generate character strings matching trending models definitions (see previous section) and then using the eval(parse(text = my_text)) trick to turn these into actual models. The simplest approach is to: generate text matching the right-hand side of the formula of the different models (we later refer to this as model content) build character strings matching model calls using the terms in 1); sprintf is particularly handy for this part transform these character strings to actual model calls within a lapply Here is a toy example illustrating the approach: library(trending) # step 1 mod_content &lt;- c(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;test&quot;, &quot;date&quot;, &quot;date + tests&quot;) # step 2 models_txt &lt;- sprintf( &quot;glm_model(cases ~ %s, family = poisson)&quot;, mod_content) # step 3 models &lt;- lapply(models_txt, function(e) eval(parse(text = e))) class(models) # this is a list ## [1] &quot;list&quot; length(models) # each component is a model ## [1] 4 lapply(models, class) # check classes of each model ## [[1]] ## [1] &quot;trending_glm&quot; &quot;trending_model&quot; ## ## [[2]] ## [1] &quot;trending_glm&quot; &quot;trending_model&quot; ## ## [[3]] ## [1] &quot;trending_glm&quot; &quot;trending_model&quot; ## ## [[4]] ## [1] &quot;trending_glm&quot; &quot;trending_model&quot; As the main thing that changes across models is the model content, the main task boils down to generating combinations of predictors to capture different trends in the data. To this end, we will use expand.grid, which creates all possible combinations of a given set of variables. For instance, to generate all models which: include a date effect may include a test effect may include a weekday effect may include a previous day’s incidence as predictor (cases_lag_1), i.e. autoregressive model We can use: # generate all combinations mod_content_grid &lt;- expand.grid(c(&quot;&quot;, &quot;tests&quot;), &quot;date&quot;, c(&quot;&quot;, &quot;weekday&quot;), c(&quot;&quot;, &quot;cases_lag_1&quot;)) mod_content_grid ## Var1 Var2 Var3 Var4 ## 1 date ## 2 tests date ## 3 date weekday ## 4 tests date weekday ## 5 date cases_lag_1 ## 6 tests date cases_lag_1 ## 7 date weekday cases_lag_1 ## 8 tests date weekday cases_lag_1 # concatenate the columns mod_content &lt;- apply(mod_content_grid, 1, paste, collapse = &quot; + &quot;) mod_content ## [1] &quot; + date + + &quot; ## [2] &quot;tests + date + + &quot; ## [3] &quot; + date + weekday + &quot; ## [4] &quot;tests + date + weekday + &quot; ## [5] &quot; + date + + cases_lag_1&quot; ## [6] &quot;tests + date + + cases_lag_1&quot; ## [7] &quot; + date + weekday + cases_lag_1&quot; ## [8] &quot;tests + date + weekday + cases_lag_1&quot; We see that mod_content contains the relevant model content, with some issues of additional + signs which will need removing. This can be done using simple regular expressions: ## cleanup model content mod_content &lt;- gsub(&quot;(\\\\+[ ]*)+[ ]*\\\\+&quot;, &quot; + &quot;, mod_content) # +... + -&gt; + mod_content &lt;- sub(&quot;^[ ]*\\\\+&quot;, &quot;&quot;, mod_content) # heading + mod_content &lt;- sub(&quot;\\\\+[ ]*$&quot;, &quot;&quot;, mod_content) # trailing + mod_content &lt;- sub(&quot;^[ ]+&quot;, &quot;&quot;, mod_content) # heading spaces mod_content &lt;- sub(&quot;[ ]+$&quot;, &quot;&quot;, mod_content) # trailing spaces mod_content &lt;- sub(&quot;[ ]+&quot;, &quot; &quot;, mod_content) # multiple spaces mod_content ## [1] &quot;date&quot; ## [2] &quot;tests + date&quot; ## [3] &quot;date + weekday&quot; ## [4] &quot;tests + date + weekday&quot; ## [5] &quot;date + cases_lag_1&quot; ## [6] &quot;tests + date + cases_lag_1&quot; ## [7] &quot;date + weekday + cases_lag_1&quot; ## [8] &quot;tests + date + weekday + cases_lag_1&quot; We now have clean model content which can be turned into trending models using the approach illustrated before. In the following sections, we highlight tricks for capturing specific trends in the data, but all ultimately rely on the principle illustrated here. "],["capturing-periodicity.html", "4.3 Capturing periodicity", " 4.3 Capturing periodicity Periodic changes are often observed due to either seasonality (over long time scales for seasonal diseases such as influenza), but are also frequent in the case of COVID-19 due to reporting artifacts (Figure 4.2. For instance, some countries report less cases over a weekend, followed by a spike on the following day (backlog effect). Figure 4.2: Example of periodicity in COVID-19 data. This figure illustrates a case of weekly periodicity in raw data (red dots and plain black line) captured by ASMODEE (grey dots and model envelope). Such trends can be captured by different predictors: a strict weekend effect, i.e. a categorical variable distinguishing weekends from weekdays a weekend effect including a backlog effect, i.e. a categorical variable distinguishing weekends, Mondays, and other weekdays a weekday effect, i.e. a categorical variable distinguishing each day in the week At the time of writing, only 2 and 3 are used in the data pipelines. Option 2) is implemented by the function day_of_week() in the scripts/ folder, also provided below. Option 3) is implemented in base R by weekdays. Both functions generate categorical variables from a Date input; for instance: #&#39; Convert dates to factors #&#39; #&#39; This will map a `Date&#39; vector to weekdays, with the following #&#39; distinction: #&#39; weekden, monday, of the rest of the week #&#39; #&#39; @author Thibaut #&#39; #&#39; @param date a vector of `Date` #&#39; day_of_week &lt;- function(date) { day_of_week &lt;- weekdays(date) out &lt;- vapply( day_of_week, function(x) { if (x %in% c(&quot;Saturday&quot;, &quot;Sunday&quot;)) { &quot;weekend&quot; } else if (x == &quot;Monday&quot;) { &quot;monday&quot; } else { &quot;rest_of_week&quot; } }, character(1) ) factor(out, levels = c(&quot;rest_of_week&quot;, &quot;monday&quot;, &quot;weekend&quot;)) } # generate some dates for the example some_dates &lt;- as.Date(&quot;2021-02-04&quot;) + 0:9 some_dates ## [1] &quot;2021-02-04&quot; &quot;2021-02-05&quot; &quot;2021-02-06&quot; &quot;2021-02-07&quot; &quot;2021-02-08&quot; ## [6] &quot;2021-02-09&quot; &quot;2021-02-10&quot; &quot;2021-02-11&quot; &quot;2021-02-12&quot; &quot;2021-02-13&quot; # build new variables using dplyr library(magrittr) library(dplyr) tibble(date = some_dates) %&gt;% mutate(weekend = day_of_week(date), weekday = weekdays(date)) ## # A tibble: 10 x 3 ## date weekend weekday ## &lt;date&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 2021-02-04 rest_of_week Thursday ## 2 2021-02-05 rest_of_week Friday ## 3 2021-02-06 weekend Saturday ## 4 2021-02-07 weekend Sunday ## 5 2021-02-08 monday Monday ## 6 2021-02-09 rest_of_week Tuesday ## 7 2021-02-10 rest_of_week Wednesday ## 8 2021-02-11 rest_of_week Thursday ## 9 2021-02-12 rest_of_week Friday ## 10 2021-02-13 weekend Saturday "],["capturing-trend-changes-in-the-past.html", "4.4 Capturing trend changes in the past", " 4.4 Capturing trend changes in the past ASMODEE implicitly assumes that the fitting set can be used to capture a single trend. It frequently happens, however, that this time period actually saw a change in trend, which then cannot be captured by a simple model (e.g. Figure 4.3). Figure 4.3: Example of trend change in COVID-19 data. This figure illustrates a case of change in temporal trends having occured during the fitted time period in the raw data (red dots and plain black line) captured by ASMODEE (grey dots and model envelope). The strategy we employ to address this issue is to: define a breaking point date marking the change in trend building a categorical variable period marking dates before and after using an interaction term for the effect of time (variable date) combined with period so that the model will fit a slope before and after the changing point In practice, we often ignore how to define 1). This can be addressed by generating many models, each with a different breaking point, and leaving to ASMODEE the task to select the best fitting model. This approach is not entirely straightforward to implement; we illustrate it below: # generate some dates for the example some_dates &lt;- as.Date(&quot;2021-02-04&quot;) + 0:30 some_dates ## [1] &quot;2021-02-04&quot; &quot;2021-02-05&quot; &quot;2021-02-06&quot; &quot;2021-02-07&quot; &quot;2021-02-08&quot; ## [6] &quot;2021-02-09&quot; &quot;2021-02-10&quot; &quot;2021-02-11&quot; &quot;2021-02-12&quot; &quot;2021-02-13&quot; ## [11] &quot;2021-02-14&quot; &quot;2021-02-15&quot; &quot;2021-02-16&quot; &quot;2021-02-17&quot; &quot;2021-02-18&quot; ## [16] &quot;2021-02-19&quot; &quot;2021-02-20&quot; &quot;2021-02-21&quot; &quot;2021-02-22&quot; &quot;2021-02-23&quot; ## [21] &quot;2021-02-24&quot; &quot;2021-02-25&quot; &quot;2021-02-26&quot; &quot;2021-02-27&quot; &quot;2021-02-28&quot; ## [26] &quot;2021-03-01&quot; &quot;2021-03-02&quot; &quot;2021-03-03&quot; &quot;2021-03-04&quot; &quot;2021-03-05&quot; ## [31] &quot;2021-03-06&quot; # build a dummy dataset library(magrittr) library(dplyr) x &lt;- tibble(date = some_dates) %&gt;% mutate(day = as.integer(date - min(date))) # build all changepoint variables between 10 and 20 days min_k &lt;- 5 max_k &lt;- 25 k_values &lt;- min_k:max_k df_changepoints &lt;- lapply(k_values, function(k) x %&gt;% transmute(if_else(day &lt;= k, &quot;before&quot;, &quot;after&quot;)) %&gt;% pull(1)) %&gt;% data.frame() %&gt;% tibble() %&gt;% setNames(paste0(&quot;change_&quot;, k_values)) # add changepoint variables to main data x &lt;- x %&gt;% bind_cols(df_changepoints) x ## # A tibble: 31 x 23 ## date day change_5 change_6 change_7 change_8 change_9 change_10 ## &lt;date&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 2021-02-04 0 before before before before before before ## 2 2021-02-05 1 before before before before before before ## 3 2021-02-06 2 before before before before before before ## 4 2021-02-07 3 before before before before before before ## 5 2021-02-08 4 before before before before before before ## 6 2021-02-09 5 before before before before before before ## 7 2021-02-10 6 after before before before before before ## 8 2021-02-11 7 after after before before before before ## 9 2021-02-12 8 after after after before before before ## 10 2021-02-13 9 after after after after before before ## # … with 21 more rows, and 15 more variables: change_11 &lt;chr&gt;, change_12 &lt;chr&gt;, ## # change_13 &lt;chr&gt;, change_14 &lt;chr&gt;, change_15 &lt;chr&gt;, change_16 &lt;chr&gt;, ## # change_17 &lt;chr&gt;, change_18 &lt;chr&gt;, change_19 &lt;chr&gt;, change_20 &lt;chr&gt;, ## # change_21 &lt;chr&gt;, change_22 &lt;chr&gt;, change_23 &lt;chr&gt;, change_24 &lt;chr&gt;, ## # change_25 &lt;chr&gt; Once these variables have been created, one can build the corresponding models using the same approach as before: library(trending) # step 1 mod_content &lt;- paste(&quot;date * change&quot;, k_values, sep = &quot;_&quot;) mod_content ## [1] &quot;date * change_5&quot; &quot;date * change_6&quot; &quot;date * change_7&quot; &quot;date * change_8&quot; ## [5] &quot;date * change_9&quot; &quot;date * change_10&quot; &quot;date * change_11&quot; &quot;date * change_12&quot; ## [9] &quot;date * change_13&quot; &quot;date * change_14&quot; &quot;date * change_15&quot; &quot;date * change_16&quot; ## [13] &quot;date * change_17&quot; &quot;date * change_18&quot; &quot;date * change_19&quot; &quot;date * change_20&quot; ## [17] &quot;date * change_21&quot; &quot;date * change_22&quot; &quot;date * change_23&quot; &quot;date * change_24&quot; ## [21] &quot;date * change_25&quot; # step 2 models_txt &lt;- sprintf(&quot;glm_model(cases ~ %s, family = poisson)&quot;, mod_content) # step 3 models &lt;- lapply(models_txt, function(e) eval(parse(text = e))) class(models) # this is a list ## [1] &quot;list&quot; length(models) # each component is a model ## [1] 21 models %&gt;% head(4) %&gt;% # only check for 4 models lapply(get_formula) # check formulas ## [[1]] ## cases ~ date * change_5 ## &lt;environment: 0x55629f265f90&gt; ## ## [[2]] ## cases ~ date * change_6 ## &lt;environment: 0x55629f273270&gt; ## ## [[3]] ## cases ~ date * change_7 ## &lt;environment: 0x55629f357130&gt; ## ## [[4]] ## cases ~ date * change_8 ## &lt;environment: 0x55629f364480&gt; Note that of course, changes in trend may happen in conjunction with other processes, such as periodicity (e.g. Figure 4.4). In such cases, the approach illustrated at the beginning of this chapter can be used to generate model contents with/without change and with/without periodic effect. Figure 4.4: Example of trend change with periodicity in COVID-19 data. This figure illustrates a case of change in temporal trends having occured during the fitted time period, combined with weekly periodicity in the raw data (red dots and plain black line) captured by ASMODEE (grey dots and model envelope). "],["final-considerations.html", "4.5 Final considerations", " 4.5 Final considerations The approaches illustrated in this chapter should help characterise a majority of temporal trends in other disease surveillance data. In this last section, we provide additional insights into implementing ASMODEE for other data: 4.5.1 Use AIC The original ASMODEE publication (Jombart et al. 2021) introduces different approaches for selecting the best model to characterise past trends. In this, we were suggesting that repeated K-fold cross-validation might lead to selecting models with better predictive power. However, we have since realised that while this approach indeed selects models with good average predictions, it ignores model variability, and might retain models which completely under-estimate the variation in the data. For instance, it may retain a Poisson model over a Negative Binomial GLM, both with similar average predictions, but the Poisson having a much too narrow prediction interval, resulting in most data points being classified as outliers. The alternative is to use Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC, (Akaike 1974)). This approach is much faster, and as it tries to minimize the deviance not explained by the model, it is able to select models which better account for the variation in the data. 4.5.2 Negative Binomial: the good and the bad In many instances, the Negative Binomial (NegBin) GLM is the most appropriate model for case counts data, as it better accounts for the variation in the data than the Poisson GLM. So in principle, one would like to use this model for most data. Unfortunately, the NegBin GLM is also prone to convergence issues, in which case it merely issues a warning during the fitting phase. This is especially frequent when there are zeros in the data (e.g. backlog effect). By default, ASMODEE will ignore these models, treating them as failure (see argument include_fitting_warnings in ?asmodee). We recommend keeping this behaviour, and ensuring as a ‘backup’ plan that all models formulated as a NegBin GLM also have at least one counterpart as another type of model, such as a Gaussian GLM or a linear regression. 4.5.3 Keep it simple ASMODEE performs best by using many simple models as candidates, rather than a few complex ones. Indeed, complex models are prone to over-fitting, and may have poor predictive value, so that they will not be useful to identify outliers in the recent days. In this infrastructure, the most complex model would be that of an exponential growth/decline (1 parameter) with a change point (2 parameters), and effect of testing (1 parameter), and weekly periodicity with a different offset for each day of the week (6 parameters). As our fitting dataset contains 6 weeks of data (42 data points), the most complex model still has 32 degrees of freedom, which means we are unlikely to over-fit the data. It is also important to ensure that at least one model will work in any case. When analysing a range of locations (e.g. countries in this infrastructure), ASMODEE will attempt to fit all candidate models to a given country, and retain the best fitting one, ignoring models which errored or issued warnings. However, ASMODEE will generate an error if not a single model could be fitted to a given country. To avoid this situation, it is best to make sure at least one model will always work. This can be achieved by using a simple, constant model, e.g. by including the one of the following in the candidate models: library(trending) cst_lm &lt;- lm_model(cases ~ 1) cst_gaussian &lt;- glm_model(cases ~ 1, family = gaussian) "],["automation.html", "Chapter 5 Automation", " Chapter 5 Automation There are many ways to automate data infrastructures. Here, we use github actions, which seemd like a natural choice given that the whole infrastructure is hosted on github. However, note that alternatives could be considered especially for group owning a dedicated server which they can administrate at will - this will likely be a more robust solution for achieving automation. In particular, it would make troubleshooting much easier, as github actions do not let the user directly interact with the server running the jobs. In this chapter, we provide a few insights into how github actions have been implemented. "],["overview-of-the-github-actions.html", "5.1 Overview of the github actions", " 5.1 Overview of the github actions Github actions permit to run parts of data pipelines automatically, as summarised in figure 2.1. The results of github action runs as well as the corresponding files are available on github under the ‘actions’ tab. In particular, this page shows the current status of the different actions: running (yellow): the job is currently running passed (green): the last job ran successfully failed (red): the last job errored In every case, logs are available. These are particularly useful for troubleshooting issues. Each github action is defined by a YAML file stored in the hidden folder .github/workflows/, currently containing: ## [1] &quot;auto_synthesis.yml&quot; &quot;auto_update_afro.yml&quot; &quot;auto_update_all.yml&quot; ## [4] &quot;auto_update_emro.yml&quot; &quot;auto_update_euro.yml&quot; &quot;auto_update_paho.yml&quot; ## [7] &quot;auto_update_searo.yml&quot; &quot;auto_update_wpro.yml&quot; &quot;refresh_readme.yml&quot; auto_update_[region].yml: analysis updates for a given region auto_update_all.yml: same, but for all regions auto_synthesis.yml: collects existing results for all regions, generate ELR report and send information products by email to a list of recipients refresh_readme.yml: update the README.md file Sub-sections below provide more information on these actions. 5.1.1 Regional updates 5.1.1.1 Outline This set of actions (one per WHO region) are implemented in the auto_update_[region].yml files. They automate the following workflow: download and prepare the current data run all analyses for the region under consideration commit and push to github the resulting information products to the asmodee_outputs/ folder - see details on the regional analyses in the report chapter 3 notes: neither the data nor the compiled report (usually stored in the outputs/ folder) are commited or pushed to github 5.1.1.2 Schedule These actions run every day at 12:30, 14:30, and 18:30 GMT. It can also be triggered manually from the github action page (see figure @(fig:action-trigger) below. Figure 5.1: Manual trigger of actions from the github action page. 5.1.2 Updates of all regions 5.1.2.1 Outline This action is implemented in the auto_update_all.yml and automate the same workflow as the regional updates, but for all regions. 5.1.2.2 Schedule This action runs every day at 16:00 and 22:00 GMT. It can also be triggered manually from the github action page (see figure @(fig:action-trigger). As an option, the user can specify a single WHO region (using the upper case abbreviations) when manually triggering a run of this action. 5.1.3 ELR synthesis 5.1.3.1 Outline This action is implemented in the auto_synthesis and automates the following workflow: compile results of all regions using the latest analyses on github from the asmodee_outputs/ folder generates an ELR report - see details on the ELR synthesis in the report chapter 3 creates a zip archive of: the ELR report as a self-contained html file an xlsx spreadsheet containing ELRs for all countries alongside key indicators a text file listing countries excluded from the analysis as well as the rationale for their exclusion sends an email to a list of recipients hard-coded in the script run_synthesis.R (located in the root folder) with this zip attached notes: this job does not commit anything to github; the only end-result persisting after the job has run is the email and its attachments 5.1.3.2 Schedule This action runs every Monday at 6:00 GMT. It can also be triggered manually from the github action page (see figure @(fig:action-trigger). 5.1.3.3 Automated emails Automated emails as currently implemented require SMTP authentication for the free SMTP provider sendinblue. This is currently done through Thibaut Jombart’s account, linked to the gmail address thibautjombart@gmail.com. While emails will look like they were sent from this email, they were actually sent by a different provider, which will often result in these emails being marked as SPAM. Double-check your SPAM folder if you are on the list of recipients and seem to have missed the email. 5.1.4 README updates 5.1.4.1 Outline This action is implemented in the refresh_readme.yml and ensures that the README.md displaying results on the landing page of the github project is updated every time new results are generated. The README is updated by recompiling the file README.Rmd. 5.1.4.2 Schedule This action runs every time there is a push to the main branch resulting in a change of files, excluding: README.md run_synthesis.R report_sources/elr_review.Rmd "],["using-secrets.html", "5.2 Using secrets", " 5.2 Using secrets 5.2.1 Github secrets in a nutshell The automation process may require inputs such as passwords and authentication tokens which cannot be stored on a public github repository for obvious security reasons. Github actions provide a workaround for such issues through github secrets. Secrets are essentially small bits of data stored encrypted on github, which are tied to a specific repository (figure 5.2). Once set up, a secret cannot be viewed again, but it can be modified or deleted. Figure 5.2: Github secret page. This screenshot shows the location of github secrets on the infrastructure’s page, underthe Settings tab. New secrets can be added there, and old secrets can be modified, but not visualised. 5.2.2 Using secrets in R workflows The data stored in a secret can be used inside github actions by referring the their value as ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }} where SECRET_NAME is the name of the secret. The approach to use this in an R workflow is then: set the secret value (e.g. a password) as an environment variable retrieve the value of the environment variable from R via Sys.getenv() use the value in the R workflow, making sure that it is never output to the console, a file, or a persistent object, as these could then become public (e.g. in logs of actions) At the time of writing, secrets are used for two purposes: to store the phifunc_token required to install the phifunc package; this enables github actions to use phifunc to download and process data to store the SMTP password used to send automated emails Outside of R workflows, we also use another secret, a Personal Authentication Token (PAT), to enable pushing to different branches of the github repository. Figure 5.3 shows how secrets can be used in the configuration file of a github action. Figure 5.3: Sample of the auto-synthesis github action using github secrets. This screenshot was taken from the github action configation file .github/workflows/auto_synthesis.yml. Secrets are outlined in red. The first two (PHIFUNC_TOKEN and SENDINBLUE_SMTP_PASSWORD) are set up as environment variables, while the last one (PAT_TIBO) is passed directly as an input to the checkout action. Note that in the case of phifunc_token, we need to handle a non-trivial situation as the token could be available in two different ways: stored locally in the root folder, in the case of a person’s computer who was granted access and given the token file; this file is git-ignored and so should never end up on github available as an environment variable, in the case of github actions This explains the circumvoluted code handling the installation of phifunc in scripts/remote_packages.R: # Here we handle the phifunc install token as follows, by order of decreasing # priority: ## 1. Grab the token from a local &#39;phifunc_token&#39; file if it exists ## 2. Grab the token the environment variable &#39;PHIFUNC_TOKEN&#39; ## 3. If the above is empty, set the value to NULL phifunc_token_file &lt;- here::here(&quot;phifunc_token&quot;) if (file.exists(phifunc_token_file)) { phifunc_token &lt;- scan(phifunc_token_file, what = &quot;character&quot;) } else { phifunc_token &lt;- Sys.getenv(&quot;PHIFUNC_TOKEN&quot;) if (phifunc_token == &quot;&quot;) phifunc_token &lt;- NULL } # Install phifunc if (!is.null(phifunc_token) &amp; !require(&quot;phifunc&quot;)) { remotes::install_github( &quot;whocov/phifunc&quot;, auth_token = phifunc_token, subdir = &quot;phifunc&quot;, upgrade = &quot;never&quot;) } "],["references.html", "References", " References "]]
