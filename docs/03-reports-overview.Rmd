# Overview of the reports {#reports}

This chapter provides some additional informations about the different
*Rmarkdown* reports. For details of data processing and analyses, we refer to
the respective documents, as we attempted to document all code in each
report. We recommend compiling the reports first and looking at the *html*
outputs generated as a more user-friendly alternative to inspecting the source
code directly.

Reports can be **compiled** by two ways:

1. using `reportfactory::compile_reports(...)` where `...` is a character string
  matching the name(s) of the reports to be processed (regular expression
  accepted); outputs will be stored in time-stamped folders inside *outputs/*

2. using the usual `rmarkdown::render(...)` where `...` is the path of the `Rmd`
  document to process; outputs will be stored inside *report_sources/*

Some reports accept **parameters**, i.e. variables set at compilation time which can
impact the results generated. This is typically used, for instance, to indicate
which WHO region the analyses are to be performed on, and is a more sustainable
alternative to handling separate reports for every region. For both compilation
methods the way to specify parameters to a report is the same; passing a list
called `param` when compiling documents. For instance:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(reportfactory)
compile_reports(report = "analyses",
                params = list(who_region = "AFRO")

```

will compile the analysis report *regional_analyses.Rmd* (only match for the
word `"analyses"`) for the AFRO region.

**Default values of parameters** are set in the YAML headers of the respective
reports.



## Data preparation: *assemble_data.Rmd*

This report downloads the data and pre-processes it to enable further analyses.

### Inputs

The package *phifunc* is used to download publicly-available, national COVID-19
data, and to do some of the pre-processing. Unfortunately, this package uses WHO
internal APIs for some of these tasks and cannot be made publicly available
without exposing these APIs, which would be a security breach. As a result, the
package can only be installed with an **authentication token**, which needs to be
stored in a file called *phifunc_token* at the root of the project folder.


### Outputs

The main output of the report is a clean data file containing data for all
countries named *final_dat_[date].rds*, a copy of which will be stored in the
*data/clean* folder. These files are ignored by *git*, and will not be added to
the *github* repository to reduce the size of the archive.


### Parameters

The report accepts the following parameters:

* `import_data`: a `logical` indicating if the data should be downloaded
  (`TRUE`, default), or if local copies of the last raw data downloaded should
  be used (`FALSE`)
  

### Example compilation

The following instructions will compile the report:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(reportfactory)
compile_reports(report = "assemble")

```







## Analyses of COVID-19 dynamics: *regional_analyses.Rmd*

This report uses the latest clean data to perform a range of analyses for a
specific WHO region. Analyses include estimation of the growth rate, detection
of trend changes using ASMODEE, and figures summarising the overall dynamics of
COVID-19 by country (pinplots and tadpoles).

### Inputs

The latest data are automatically detected and loaded by the auxiliary function
`load_final_data()`, defined in *scripts/data_loaders.R*


```{r echo = FALSE}

cap <-
"Example of pinplot. This figure summarises the dynamics of COVID-19 at a national level, using three complementary metrics: the daily growth rate *r* (*x* axis), the current weekly incidence (*y* axis), and the number of net increases showing trend acceleration detected by ASMODEE (colors). Another variant of this figure uses weekly incidence of deaths per capita on the *y* axis. Countries to the right show faster epidemic growth, and countries near the top experience high levels of incidence. Countries displayed in red show signs of acceleration, so that they may move further to the right in the coming days. This figure was generated for EMRO on 11th July 2021."

```


```{r pinplot, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap = cap}
knitr::include_graphics('images/example_pinplot.png', dpi = NA)
```


### Outputs

The main output of the report is a `list` exported as a file named
_asmodee_outputs_[WHO region]_[data].rds_ stored in */asmodee_outputs/rds/*, and
containing the following elements:

* `$summary`: summary of the ASMODEE results
* `$results`: outputs of ASMODEE
* `$plot_overall_deaths`: *ggplot2* object of the overall dynamics plot using
  death per capita on the y-axis
* `$plot_overall_peaks`: *ggplot2* object of the overall dynamics plot using
  incidence as percentage of historical peak on the y-axis
* `$df_dynamics`: a `data.frame` containing all the required info to recreate
  either global dynamics plots
* `$elr_extras`: a `data.frame` containing additional information for countries,
  including TPR and vaccination coverage
* `$timestamp`: the timestamp corresponding to the date of the dataset used in
  the analyses 

Other outputs include:

* **pinplots** and **tadpoles** figures saved *asmodee_outputs/png/*; these
  figures summarise the COVID-19 dynamics according to the *growth rate*, the
  current weekly *incidence*, and the number of net accelerations identified by
  ASMODEE; pinplots show the current situation (see example in Figure
  \@ref(fig:pinplot), while tadpoles show the trajectories of countries over the
  last few days
  
* **notes** listing countries that were excluded from the analyses alongside the
  reason for their exclusion, stored in a markdown file named _analysis_notes_[WHO
  region]_[data].md_ stored in */asmodee_outputs/notes/*


### Parameters

The report accepts the following parameters:

* `who_region`: the code of the WHO region used in the analyses; possible values
are (keep the upper case): `AFRO`, `EMRO`, `EURO` (default), `PAHO`, `SEARO`,
`WPRO`

* `n_cores`: the number of cores/processors to be used for ASMODEE; as the
  method supports parallelisation, more cores usually mean faster analyses;
  defaults to 1 (no parallelisation)
  
* `tadpole_size`: the number of days to be considered when showing the
  trajectories of the countries on tadpoles plots; defaults to 7
  

### Example compilation

The following instructions will compile the report for EMRO, using 12 cores for
the calculations; also note the use of `subfolder` which will ensure that
results are stored in a timestamped folder in *outputs/EMRO/* (rather than in
*outputs/*):

```{r eval = FALSE}

library(reportfactory)
rmarkdown::render('regional_analyses',
                  params = list(n_cores = 12, who_region = "EMRO"),
                  subfolder = "EMRO")

```

The following loop will do the same but for every region:

```{r eval = FALSE}

library(reportfactory)
regions <- c("AFRO", "EMRO", "EURO", "PAHO", "SEARO", "WPRO")

for (reg in regions) {
rmarkdown::render('regional_analyses',
                  params = list(n_cores = 12, who_region = reg),
                  subfolder = reg)
}

```







## Synthesis: *elr_synthesis.Rmd*

This report compiles results of all WHO regions, defines ELR for the countries,
and stores the main results into an *xlsx* file.

### Inputs

The report compiles the latest results obtained for the different WHO regions
stored in `asmodee_outputs/rds/`.


### Outputs

Based on the metrics used in the pinplots, countries are assigned an ELR using
the algorithm summarised in figure \@ref(fig:elr-algo). The report provides
complementary informations including trend plots (ASMODEE results) for the
countries with *Medium* risk or higher, and some additional information on
Testing Positivity Rates (TPR) and vaccination coverage.


```{r echo = FALSE}

cap <-
"Algorithm to define Epi Level of Risk (**ELR**). This diagram summarises the algorithm used to define a risk level (*Low* / *Medium* / *High* / *Very High*) based on values of the daily growth rates, weekly incidence, and signs of acceleration in transmission. Grey squares indicate *Minimal* risk. *Intel adjustments* represent the possibility for other sources of information (e.g. status of the healthcare system) to shift ELR by one level (or more in extreme cases) right or left."

```

```{r elr-algo, fig.align = 'center', echo = FALSE, fig.cap = cap, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/elr_algo.png')
```

Besides the `html` version of the report, other outputs include:

* `dynamics_synthesis.xlsx`: and Excel spreadsheet providing the ELR for each
 country alongside the different metrics used in the algorithm as well as
 additional information on TPR and vaccination coverage
 
 * `excluded_countries.txt`: a text file listing all countries that were
   excluded from the analysis alongside the reason for their exclusion
   


### Parameters

The report does not accept parameters.
  

### Example compilation

The following instructions will compile the report:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(reportfactory)
compile_reports(report = "synthesis")

```
